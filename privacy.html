                    <p>Not all information requested, collected, and processed by us is “Personal Information” as it does not identify you as a specific natural person. This will include majority of “User Generated Content” that you provide us with the intention
                        of sharing with other users inside a transaction. Such “Non-Personal Information” is not covered by this privacy policy. However, as non-personal information may be used in aggregate or be linked with existing personal information;
                        when in this form it will be treated as personal information. As such, this privacy policy will list both types of information for the sake of transparency.</p>
                    <p>In some situation users may provide us with personal information without us asking for it, or through means not intended for the collection of particular types of information. Whilst we may take reasonable steps to protect this data,
                        the user will have bypassed our systems, processes, and control and thus the information provided will not be governed by this privacy policy.</p>
                    <p>In some situations users may provide us personal information over platforms that are outside our control; for example through social media or forums. Whilst any information collected by us is governed by this Privacy Policy, the platform
                        by which it was communicated will be governed by its own Privacy Policy.</p>

                        of non-personal data that can be linked with personal data, it will either be erased or otherwise anonymised from the personal data.</p>
